Graphics and visualization
**************************

The 3D OpenGL graphics renderer window is kept simple, but useful to see the animated results of the multibody system.
The graphics output is restricted to a 3D window (renderwindow) into which the renderer draws the visualization state of the \ ``MainSystem``\  \ ``mbs``\ .
Note that visualization parameters can be widely changed (more than 200 parameters ...), see Section :ref:`sec-overview-basics-visualizationsettings`\ .
