- | \ *function description*\ :
  | Function to add many distance sensors to represent Lidar; sensors can be either placed on absolute position or attached to rigid body marker
- | \ *input*\ :
  | \ ``generalContactIndex``\ : the number of the GeneralContact object in mbs; the index of the GeneralContact object which has been added with last AddGeneralContact(...) command is generalContactIndex=mbs.NumberOfGeneralContacts()-1
  | \ ``positionOrMarker``\ : either a 3D position as list or np.array, or a MarkerIndex with according rigid body marker
  | \ ``minDistance``\ : the minimum distance which is accepted; smaller distance will be ignored
  | \ ``maxDistance``\ : the maximum distance which is accepted; items being at maxDistance or futher are ignored; if no items are found, the function returns maxDistance
  | \ ``cylinderRadius``\ : in case of spheres (selectedTypeIndex=ContactTypeIndex.IndexSpheresMarkerBased), a cylinder can be used which measures the shortest distance at a certain radius (geometrically interpreted as cylinder)
  | \ ``lineLength``\ : length of line to be drawn; note that this length is drawn from obstacle towards sensor if drawDisplaced=True, but the length is always constant
  | \ ``numberOfSensors``\ : number of sensors arranged between angleStart and angleEnd; higher numbers give finer resolution (but requires more CPU time)
  | \ ``angleStart``\ : starting rangle of angles to be used (in radiant)
  | \ ``angleEnd``\ : end of range for angle to be used (in radiant)
  | \ ``inclination``\ : angle of inclination (radiant), positive values showing upwards if placed
  | \ ``rotation``\ : a 3x3 rotation matrix (numpy); the sensor is placed in the X-Y plane of the marker where it is added to; however, you can use this rotation matrix to change the orientation
  | \ ``selectedTypeIndex``\ : either this type has default value, meaning that all items in GeneralContact are measured, or there is a specific type index, which is the only type that is considered during measurement
  | \ ``storeInternal``\ : like with any SensorUserFunction, setting to True stores sensor data internally
  | \ ``fileName``\ : if defined, recorded data of SensorUserFunction is written to specified file
  | \ ``measureVelocity``\ : if True, the sensor measures additionally the velocity (component 0=distance, component 1=velocity); velocity is the velocity in direction 'dirSensor' and does not account for changes in geometry, thus it may be different from the time derivative of the distance!
  | \ ``addGraphicsObject``\ : if True, the distance sensor is also visualized graphically in a simplified manner with a red line having the length of dirSensor; NOTE that updates are ONLY performed during computation, not in visualization; for this reason, solutionSettings.sensorsWritePeriod should be accordingly small
  | \ ``drawDisplaced``\ : if True, the red line is drawn backwards such that it moves along the measured surface; if False, the beam is fixed to marker or position
  | \ ``color``\ : optional color for 'laser beam' to be drawn
- | \ *output*\ :
  | creates sensor and returns list of sensor numbers for all laser sensors
- | \ *notes*\ :
  | use generalContactIndex = CreateDistanceSensorGeometry(...) before to create GeneralContact module containing geometry
