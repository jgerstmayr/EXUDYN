Flexible beams tutorial
=======================

This tutorial briefly introduces two simple planar beams and how to work with them with utility functions.
The python source code of the beam tutorial can be found at:

   \ ``main/pythonDev/Examples/beamTutorial.py``\ 

The tutorial uses the GeometricallyExactBeam2D, which is a shear deformable Reissner-Timoshenko beam, and a thin cable ANCFCable2D, which represents a large deformation Bernoulli-Euler beam.

The model includes two highly flexible planar with length 2m, height 0.005m, width 0.01m, 
Young's modulus 1e9N/m\ :math:`^2`\  and density 2000kg/m\ :math:`^3`\ .
The shear deformable beam is rigidly attached to ground and the cable is rigidly attached to a moving ground.

We first import necessary libraries and set up a mbs. Note that utilities also include pi, sin, cos and sqrt.

.. code-block:: python

  import exudyn as exu
  from exudyn.utilities import *
  import numpy as np

  SC = exu.SystemContainer()
  mbs = SC.AddSystem()



We define a set of beam parameters, discretization and geometry for both beam models.

.. code-block:: python

  numberOfElements = 16
  L = 2                     # length of pendulum 
  E=2e11                    # steel
  rho=7800                  # elastomer
  h=0.005                   # height of rectangular beam element in m
  b=0.01                    # width of rectangular beam element in m
  A=b*h                     # cross sectional area of beam element in m^2
  I=b*h**3/12               # second moment of area of beam element in m^4
  nu = 0.3                  # Poisson's ratio
      
  EI = E*I
  EA = E*A
  rhoA = rho*A
  rhoI = rho*I
  ks = 10*(1+nu)/(12+11*nu) # shear correction factor
  G = E/(2*(1+nu))          # shear modulus
  GA = ks*G*A               # shear stiffness of beam

  g = [0,-9.81,0]           # gravity vector

  positionOfNode0 = [0,0,0] # 3D vector
  positionOfNode1 = [L,0,0] # 3D vector



Build geometrically exact 2D beam template (Timoshenko-Reissner), which includes all parameters
In order to create beams, we usually need to create 2D rigid body nodes, 
create beam elements, add constraints and loads.

However, there is a utility function \ ``GenerateStraightBeam(...)``\ , 
which conveniently does this for straight beams, including discretization, constraints and gravity.
First, we create a beam template, which includes all beam parameters (this could also be another beam type):

.. code-block:: python

  beamTemplate = Beam2D(nodeNumbers = [-1,-1], #added later
                        physicsMassPerLength=rhoA,
                        physicsCrossSectionInertia=rhoI,
                        physicsBendingStiffness=EI,
                        physicsAxialStiffness=EA,
                        physicsShearStiffness=GA,
                        physicsBendingDamping=0.02*EI,
                        visualization=VObjectBeamGeometricallyExact2D(drawHeight = h))



Now we use this template and call \ ``GenerateStraightBeam``\ , which takes the nodal positions,
calculates according beam element lengths from discretization and could add constraints,
if \ ``fixedConstraintsNode0``\  or \ ``fixedConstraintsNode1``\  are not \ ``None``\ .

.. code-block:: python

  beamData = GenerateStraightBeam(mbs, positionOfNode0, positionOfNode1, 
                                  numberOfElements, beamTemplate, gravity= g, 
                                  fixedConstraintsNode0=[1,1,1], 
                                  fixedConstraintsNode1=None)



We perform the same operations for ANCF cable elemente (Bernoulli-Euler),
but in this case, we do not add constraints:

.. code-block:: python

  beamTemplate = Cable2D(nodeNumbers = [-1,-1], #added later
                         physicsMassPerLength=rhoA,
                         physicsBendingStiffness=EI,
                         physicsAxialStiffness=EA,
                         physicsBendingDamping=0.02*EI,
                         visualization=VCable2D(drawHeight = h))

  cableData = GenerateStraightBeam(mbs, positionOfNode0, positionOfNode1, 
                                   numberOfElements, beamTemplate, gravity= g, 
                                   fixedConstraintsNode0=None, 
                                   fixedConstraintsNode1=None)



Now, we create a ground object and markers to attach cable with generic joint

.. code-block:: python

  oGround = mbs.CreateGround(referencePosition=[0,0,0])
  mGround = mbs.AddMarker(MarkerBodyRigid(bodyNumber=oGround, localPosition=[0,0,0]))

  mCable = mbs.AddMarker(MarkerNodeRigid(nodeNumber=cableData[0][0]))



As we like to move the cable relative to ground, we employ a simple 
user function which prescribes relative rotation and (corotated) translation in the joint:

.. code-block:: python

  def UFoffset(mbs, t, itemNumber, offsetUserFunctionParameters):
      x = SmoothStep(t, 2, 4, 0, 0.5)   #translate in local joint coordinates
      phi = SmoothStep(t, 5, 10, 0, pi) #rotates frame of mGround
      return [x, 0,0,0,0,phi]




Finally, we add the rigid joint (2D displacements and rotation around Z fixed) as GenericJoint.
Note that for 2D objects, we may only fix \ :math:`X`\ - and \ :math:`Y`\ -translations, as well as the \ :math:`Z`\ -rotation

.. code-block:: python

  mbs.AddObject(GenericJoint(markerNumbers=[mGround, mCable],
                             constrainedAxes=[1,1,0, 0,0,1],
                             offsetUserFunction=UFoffset,
                             visualization=VGenericJoint(axesRadius=0.01,
                                                         axesLength=0.02)))



As in the previous example, we just need to assemble and set up simulation parameters:

.. code-block:: python

  mbs.Assemble()

  simulationSettings = exu.SimulationSettings()
      
  tEnd = 10
  stepSize = 0.005
  simulationSettings.timeIntegration.numberOfSteps = int(tEnd/stepSize)
  simulationSettings.timeIntegration.endTime = tEnd
  simulationSettings.timeIntegration.verboseMode = 1
  simulationSettings.solutionSettings.solutionWritePeriod = 0.005
  simulationSettings.solutionSettings.writeSolutionToFile = True

  simulationSettings.linearSolverType = exu.LinearSolverType.EigenSparse
  simulationSettings.timeIntegration.newton.useModifiedNewton = True #for faster simulation

  ## add some visualization settings
  SC.visualizationSettings.nodes.defaultSize = 0.01
  SC.visualizationSettings.nodes.drawNodesAsPoint = False #show beam nodes
  SC.visualizationSettings.bodies.beams.crossSectionFilled = True



Now start the solver with visualization and run the solution viewer afterwards,
because simulation may be faster than you can follow:

.. code-block:: python

  exu.StartRenderer()
  mbs.SolveDynamic(simulationSettings)
  exu.StopRenderer()

  ## visualize computed solution:
  mbs.SolutionViewer()



The visualization window for the solution drawn at 6.5s is shown in \ :numref:`fig-tutorial-beams`\ .


.. _fig-tutorial-beams:
.. figure:: ../theDoc/figures/TutorialBeams.png
   :width: 500

   Render window showing the deformed state of the two beams at 6.5s. The lower beam is fixed at the left end, while the upper beam's support is translated and rotated.



This example should give you a good starting point to create beam models.
See further examples, and more advanced functions, e.g., to create curved beam or reeving systems.
There are also a sliding joint as well as axially moving beams and contact between beams and sheaves.

3D beams are still under development and include less functionality. In case, send a request at the GitHub discussion or issues.
