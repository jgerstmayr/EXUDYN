This section will show:

+  A basic tutorial for a 1D mass and spring-damper with initial displacements, shortest possible model with practically no special settings
+  A more advanced rigid-body model, including 3D rigid bodies and revolute joints
+  Links to examples section

A large number of examples, some of them quite advanced, can be found in:

   \ ``main/pythonDev/Examples``\ 
   \ ``main/pythonDev/TestModels``\
