This section covers some advanced topics, which may be only relevant for a smaller group of people. 
Functionality may be extended but also removed in future

Camera following objects and interacting with model view
--------------------------------------------------------

For some models, it may be advantageous to track the translation and/or rotation of certain bodies, e.g., for cars, (wheeled) robots or bicycles. 
Since Exudyn 1.4.18 you can attach view to a marker, using the visualization setting

.. code-block:: python

  SC.visualizationSettings.interactive.trackMarker = nMarker


in which \ ``nMarker``\  represents the desired marker number to follow.
See also related options in \ ``SC.visualizationSettings.interactive``\  in Section :ref:`sec-vsettingsinteractive`\ .

The following paragraph represents a slower, slightly outdated approach, which may be interesting for advanced usage of object tracking.
To do so, the current render state (\ ``SC.GetRenderState()``\ , \ ``SC.SetRenderState(...)``\ ) can be obtained and modified, in order to always follow a certain position.
As this needs to be done during redraw of every frame, it is conveniently done in a graphicsUserFunction, e.g., within the ground body. This is shown in the following example, in which \ ``mbs.variables['nTrackNode']``\  is a node number to be tracked:

.. code-block:: python

  #mbs.variables['nTrackNode'] contains node number
  def UFgraphics(mbs, objectNum):
      n = mbs.variables['nTrackNode']
      p = mbs.GetNodeOutput(n,exu.OutputVariableType.Position, 
                            configuration=exu.ConfigurationType.Visualization)
      rs=SC.GetRenderState() #get current render state
      A = np.array(rs['modelRotation'])
      p = A.T @ p #transform point into model view coordinates
      rs['centerPoint']=[p[0],p[1],p[2]]
      SC.SetRenderState(rs)  #modify render state
      return []

  #add object with graphics user function
  oGround2 = mbs.AddObject(ObjectGround(visualization=
                 VObjectGround(graphicsDataUserFunction=UFgraphics)))
  #.... further code for simulation here


NOTE that this approach is slower and it may lead to a (usually silient) crash after closing the renderer, as the renderer thread is somehow coupled to Python which is prohibited from Python side.

.. _sec-overview-advanced-contact:


Contact problems
----------------

Since Q4 2021 a contact module is available in Exudyn. 
This separate module \ ``GeneralContact``\  [\ **still under development, consider with care!**\ ] is highly optimized and implemented with parallelization (multi-threaded) for certain types of contact elements.


.. _fig-contactexamples:
.. figure:: ../theDoc/figures/contactTests.png
   :width: 450
   
.. figure:: ../theDoc/figures/contactTests2.jpg
   :width: 450
  
   Some tests and examples using \ ``GeneralContact``\ 





\ **Note**\ :

+  \ ``GeneralContact``\  is (in most cases) restricted to dynamic simulation (explicit or implicit [\ **still under development, consider with care!**\ ] ) if friction is used; without friction, it also works in the static case
+  in addition to \ ``GeneralContact``\  there are special objects, in particular for rolling and simple 1D contacts, that are available as single objects, cf. \ ``ObjectConnectorRollingDiscPenalty``\ 
+  \ ``GeneralContact``\  is recommended to be used for large numbers of contacts, while the single objects are integrated more directly into mbs.


Currently, \ ``GeneralContact``\  includes:

+  Sphere-Sphere contact (attached to any marker); may represent circle-circle contact in 2D
+  Triangles mounted on rigid bodies, in contact with Spheres [only explicit]
+  ANCFCable2D contacting with spheres (which then represent circles in 2D) [partially implicit, needs revision]

For details on the contact formulations, see Section :ref:`seccontacttheory`\ .


.. _sec-overview-advanced-openvr:


OpenVR
------

The general open source libraries from Valve, see

   https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr

have been linked to Exudyn. In order to get OpenVR fully integrated, you need to run \ ``setup.py``\  Exudyn with the \ ``--openvr``\  flag. For general installation instructions, see Section :ref:`sec-install-installinstructions`\ .

Running OpenVR either requires an according head mounted display (HMD) or a virtualization using, e.g., Riftcat 2 to use a mobile phone with an according adapter. Visualization settings are available in \ ``interactive.openVR``\ , but need to be considered with care.
An example is provided in \ ``openVRengine.py``\ , showing some optimal flags like locking the model rotation, zoom or translation.

Everything is experimental, but contributions are welcome!


.. _sec-overview-advanced-julia:


Interaction with Julia
----------------------

The scientific community gets increasingly interested into the language Julia.
There is a very simple interoperability with julia -- at least from julia to Python -- which has been tests.
The other way -- calling Python from julia -- is also possible, but it is left to the reader.

After installing julia (tested on Windows 10 with julia 1.6.7), you need to add Python accessibility via \ ``PyCall``\ 
in \ **julia**\ :

.. code-block:: 

  using Pkg
  Pkg.add("PyCall")


Ideally, you have a certain Python installation where Exudyn is already installed (and for the following examples, you also need \ ``matplotlib``\ ). Find the according Python path in any \ **Python**\  console:

.. code-block:: python

  import sys
  print(sys.executable)


Use this path and adapt the following \ **julia**\  script ('raw' allows to use single backslash) in \ **julia**\ :

.. code-block:: 

  ENV["PYTHON"]=raw"C:\Users\xyz\.condavs\venvP38\python.exe"
  Pkg.build("PyCall")


Now we can interact with Python, using Python objects in \ **julia**\  almost natively, try:

.. code-block:: 

  py"""
  import exudyn
  from exudyn.demos import *

  Demo1()
  """


This will run the very simple Exudyn \ ``Demo1``\ .
As \ ``exudyn``\  is now imported into this Python session, you can access it, e.g., \ ``py"exudyn".Help()``\  
will write the help message.

To show the interoperability with julia, test the following example (similar to \ ``Demo1``\ ) in \ **julia**\ :

.. code-block:: 

  py"""
  import exudyn as exu               #EXUDYN package including C++ core part
  import exudyn.itemInterface as eii #conversion of data to exudyn dictionaries

  SC = exu.SystemContainer()         #container of systems
  mbs = SC.AddSystem()               #add a new system to work with

  nMP = mbs.AddNode(eii.NodePoint2D(referenceCoordinates=[0,0]))
  mbs.AddObject(eii.ObjectMassPoint2D(physicsMass=10, nodeNumber=nMP ))
  mMP = mbs.AddMarker(eii.MarkerNodePosition(nodeNumber = nMP))
  mbs.AddLoad(eii.Force(markerNumber = mMP, loadVector=[0.001,0,0]))

  #add a sensor:
  s = mbs.AddSensor(eii.SensorNode(nodeNumber=nMP,
                    outputVariableType=exu.OutputVariableType.Position,
                    storeInternal=True))

  mbs.Assemble()                     #assemble system and solve
  simulationSettings = exu.SimulationSettings()
  simulationSettings.timeIntegration.verboseMode=1 #provide some output
  simulationSettings.solutionSettings.coordinatesSolutionFileName = 'solution/demo1.txt'

  exu.SolveDynamic(mbs, simulationSettings)
  print('results can be found in local directory: solution/demo1.txt')
  """


We can access Python variables from julia via \ ``py"..."``\  to read out, e.g., \ ``mbs``\ :
  
.. code-block:: 

  py"mbs".systemData.Info()


We can use variables (or objects) directly in julia, e.g., 

.. code-block:: 

  mbs=py"mbs"
  print(mbs)


Finally, we can also plot values via \ ``PlotSensor``\  (\ ``matplotlib``\  in the background):

.. code-block:: 

  eplt=pyimport("exudyn.plot")
  eplt.PlotSensor(py"mbs", py"s")


We could also access the stored sensor data in julia, using

.. code-block:: 

  x = py"mbs".GetSensorStoredData(py"s")


and we could just print (or use) the first 10 rows of this data generated on the Python side, using it in \ **julia**\ :

.. code-block:: 

  x[1:10,:]


\ **NOTE**\  the 1-based indexing in julia, which highlights the limitations of this approach.

To finally check if the GLFW renderer also runs via julia, just use:

.. code-block:: 

  py"""
  from exudyn.demos import *
  Demo2()
  """


For the full range of possibilities, see `github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl <https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl>`_.



.. _sec-overview-advanced-interactwithcodes:


Interaction with other codes
----------------------------

Interaction with other codes and computers (E.g., MATLAB or other C++ codes, or other Python versions)
is possible. 
To connect to any other code, it is convenient to use a TCP/IP connection. This is enabled via 
the \ ``exudyn.utilities``\  functions

+  \ ``CreateTCPIPconnection``\ 
+  \ ``TCPIPsendReceive``\ 
+  \ ``CloseTCPIPconnection``\ 

Basically, data can be transmitted in both directions, e.g., within a preStepUserFunction. In Examples, you can find 
 TCPIPexudynMatlab.py which shows a basic example for such a connectivity.


.. _sec-overview-advanced-ros:


ROS
---

Basic interaction with ROS has been tested. However, make sure to use Python 3, as there is no (and will never be any) Python 2
support for Exudyn.
