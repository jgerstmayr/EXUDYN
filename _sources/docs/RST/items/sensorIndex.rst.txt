A Sensor is used to measure quantities during simulation. Sensors may be attached to Nodes, Objects, Markers or Loads. Sensor values may be directly read via mbs or can be continuously written to files or SensorRecorder during simulation. The exudyn.plot Python utility function PlotSensor(...) can be conveniently used to show Sensor values over time.
