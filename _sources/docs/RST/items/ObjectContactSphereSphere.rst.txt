ObjectContactSphereSphere
=========================

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION] A simple contact connector between two spheres. The connector implements at least the same functionality as in GeneralContact and is intended for simple setups and for testing, while GeneralContact is much more efficient due to parallelization approaches and efficient contact search.

Connector Forces
----------------

This section outlines the computation of the forces acting on the two spheres when they are in contact with each other. Two types of forces can act on the spheres due to the connector:

+  normal force computed according to the chosen impact model \ :math:`m_\mathrm{impact}`\  and with contact damping if \ :math:`d_c\neq0`\ ; this type of force does not create a torque acting on the spheres.
+  tangential force due to a regularized friction law to model dry friction between the spheres; this type of force creates a torque acting on the spheres and is computed independently of the chosen impact model if \ :math:`\mu_d\neq0`\  is set. Note that in the implemented model, rolling deformations are not considered, i.e. the friction is only a function of the relative tangential velocity between the spheres at the contact point.

   Two spheres that are in contact, showing a force on marker 1 in normal direction due to overlap; forces on marker 0 act in opposite direction.

For the following, the gap \ :math:`g`\  between the two spheres is computed as

.. math::

   g = || \LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m1} - \LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m0} || - (r_0 + r_1)


and the overlap \ :math:`\delta`\  is the negated gap: \ :math:`\delta=-g`\ . In the contact case, the overlap \ :math:`\delta`\  is positive. The normal vector \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}`\  points from marker 0 to marker 1 and is computed with

.. math::

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}} = \frac{\LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m1} - \LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m0}}{|| \LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m1} - \LU{0}{{\mathbf{p}}}_{m0} ||} .


The scalar normal (gap) velocity \ :math:`v_\mathrm{\delta,n}`\  is computed with the velocities \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m0}=\LU{0}{\dot{{\mathbf{p}}}}_{m0}`\  and \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m1}=\LU{0}{\dot{{\mathbf{p}}}}_{m1}`\ 

.. math::

   v_\mathrm{\delta,n} = \left(\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m1} - \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m0}\right)\cdot \LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}


and the tangential (gap) velocity \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_\mathrm{\delta,t}`\  at the contact point, that is needed for the friction model, reads

.. math::
   :label: eq-ossctangentialvelocity

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_\mathrm{\delta,t} = \left(\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a1} - \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a0}\right) - v_\mathrm{\delta,n} \cdot \LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}, \qquad v_\mathrm{rel} = || \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_\mathrm{\delta,t} || .


To take the angular velocity of the spheres into account, the velocities \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a0}`\  and \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a1}`\  at the contact point are computed using Euler's theorem for kinematics:

.. math::

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a0} = \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m0} + \LU{0}{\tomega}_{m0} \times \left(\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}\cdot \left(r_0-\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\right) , \qquad \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{a1} = \LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{m1} + \LU{0}{\tomega}_{m1} \times \left(-\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}\cdot \left(r_1-\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\right) .


The normal force acting on marker 1 is generally written as

.. math::

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_\mathrm{1,n} = \underbrace{(f_c + f_d)}_{f_\mathrm{1,n}} \cdot \LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}} ,


where \ :math:`f_c`\  is the elastic and \ :math:`f_d`\  the damping part. The damping \ :math:`f_d`\  is always computed the same, independent of the chosen impact model:

.. math::

   f_d = - d_c v_\mathrm{\delta,n} .


The negative sign is because of the damping acting against the gap velocity: in the case of a positive normal (gap) velocity, the damping acts against \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}`\  for marker 1. The elastic force \ :math:`f_c`\  is computed depending on the chosen impact model.

+  \ :math:`m_\mathrm{impact}=0`\ : the Adhesive Elasto-Plastic model described in  is used. This model captures the key bulk behavior of cohesive powders and granular soils. For the impact model, the plastic overlap \ :math:`\delta_p`\  is needed. It is computed with
  
.. math::

   \delta_p=\lambda_\mathrm{p}^{\frac{1}{n_\mathrm{exp}}}\delta .


  The Adhesive Elasto-Plastic model distinguishes three different cases, modeling the loading and unloading behavior of the spheres:
  
.. math::

   f_c= \begin{cases} -f_\mathrm{adh} + k_c \delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}} & \text{if } k_2 \left(\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}}-\delta_p^{n_\mathrm{exp}} \right) \geq k_c\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}} \\ -f_\mathrm{adh} + k_2 \left(\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}}-\delta_p^{n_\mathrm{exp}} \right) & \text{if } k_c\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}} > k_2 \left(\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}}-\delta_p^{n_\mathrm{exp}}\right) > -k_\mathrm{adh}\delta^{n_\mathrm{adh}} \\ -f_\mathrm{adh}-k_\mathrm{adh}\delta^{n_\mathrm{adh}} & \text{if } -k_\mathrm{adh}\delta^{n_\mathrm{adh}} > k_2 \left(\delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}}-\delta_p^{n_\mathrm{exp}} \right) \end{cases} .


Note that \ :math:`k_2`\  is computed with \ :math:`k_2 = k_c/(1-\lambda_\mathrm{P})`\ . The terms with the stiffness \ :math:`k_c`\  and \ :math:`k_2`\  have a positive sign, since they act in the direction of \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}`\  for marker 1. The constant adhesion force \ :math:`f_\mathrm{adh}`\  and the stiffness \ :math:`k_\mathrm{adh}`\  act against \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}`\ , which corresponds to a force sticking the spheres together.

+  \ :math:`m_\mathrm{impact}=1`\ : the restitution model proposed by Hunt and Crossley in  is used to simulate the energy loss of the spheres during contact:
  
.. math::

   f_c=k_c \delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}} + \lambda \delta^{n_\mathrm{exp}} v_\mathrm{\delta,n}


  with
  
.. math::

   \lambda = \frac{k_c}{\dot\delta_\mathrm{-}}\frac{3}{2}(e_\mathrm{res}-1) .


  The restitution coefficient \ :math:`e_\mathrm{res}`\  describes the ration of the normal (gap) velocity before and after the impact of the spheres. In the case of \ :math:`e_\mathrm{res}<1`\ , the impact has a plastic portion, resulting in a force acting against \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}`\  for marker 1, which is why \ :math:`\lambda`\  must be negative in that case. \ :math:`\dot\delta_\mathrm{-}`\  is the initial relative velocity, which is either the minimum impact velocity or the normal (negated gap) velocity:
  
.. math::

   \dot\delta_\mathrm{-} = \max{\left(\dot\delta_\mathrm{-,min}; -v_\mathrm{\delta,n} \right)}


Note that the Hunt-Crossley restitution is valid for a very small energy loss (\ :math:`e_\mathrm{res}\approx1`\ ) .

+  \ :math:`m_\mathrm{impact}=2`\ : a generalization of the Hunt-Crossley restitution proposed by Carvalho and Martins in  is used for \ :math:`e_\mathrm{res} > \frac{1}{3}`\  and a model proposed by Gonthier et al. in  is used for impacts with a high plastic proportion, \ :math:`e_\mathrm{res} < \frac{1}{3}`\ . Note that the two models are identical at \ :math:`e_\mathrm{res} = \frac{1}{3}`\ . \ :math:`\lambda`\  is therefore computed as follows:
  
.. math::

   \lambda= \begin{cases} \frac{k_c}{\dot\delta_\mathrm{-}}\frac{3}{2}(e_\mathrm{res}-1)\frac{11-e_\mathrm{res}}{1+9e_\mathrm{res}} & \text{if } e_\mathrm{res} > \frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{k_c}{\dot\delta_\mathrm{-}}\frac{e_\mathrm{rep}^2-1}{e_\mathrm{rep}} & \text{if } e_\mathrm{res} > 0 \\ \end{cases} .



The tangential force acting on marker 1 due to the friction model acts against the tangential velocity \ :math:`{\mathbf{v}}_\mathrm{\delta,t}`\ , see the computation of \ :math:`{\mathbf{v}}_\mathrm{\delta,t}`\  in Equation \ :eq:`eq-ossctangentialvelocity`\ . Thus, the tangential force for marker 1 is computed as

.. math::

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_\mathrm{1,t} = -\LU{0}{{\mathbf{v}}}_\mathrm{\delta,t} \cdot \begin{cases} \frac{\mu_d f_\mathrm{1,n}}{v_{reg}} & \text{if } v_{rel} < v_{reg} \\ \frac{\mu_d f_\mathrm{1,n}}{v_{rel}} & \text{else}\\ \end{cases} .


Note that the case distinction above is made to ensure that for very small relative velocities the friction force does not become implausibly high. Taken together, the force acting on marker 1 due to the connector is computed as

.. math::

   \LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m1}=\LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_\mathrm{1,n}+\LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_\mathrm{1,t} ,


the force acting on marker 0 is \ :math:`\LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m0}=-\LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m1}`\ . The global torque \ :math:`\LU{0}{\ttau}_{m1}`\  acting on marker 1 due to the connector is computed as

.. math::

   \LU{0}{\ttau}_{m1}=-\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}\left( r_1-\frac{1}{2}\delta \right) \times \LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m1} ,


and on marker 0 as

.. math::

   \LU{0}{\ttau}_{m0}=\LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}} \left(r_0-\frac{1}{2}\delta \right) \times \LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m0}= \LU{0}{{\mathbf{n}}}\left( r_0-\frac{1}{2}\delta \right) \times -\LU{0}{{\mathbf{f}}}_{m1} .


It can be seen that the torque due to the connector is the same for both spheres, if \ :math:`r_0=r_1`\  applies.
