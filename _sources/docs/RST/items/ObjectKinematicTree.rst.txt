ObjectKinematicTree
===================

A special object to represent open kinematic trees using minimal coordinate formulation. The kinematic tree is defined by lists of joint types, parents, inertia parameters (w.r.t. COM), etc.\ per link (body) and given joint (pre) transformations from the previous joint. Every joint / link is defined by the position and orientation of the previous joint and a coordinate transformation (incl.\ translation) from the previous link's to this link's joint coordinates. The joint can be combined with a marker, which allows to attach connectors as well as joints to represent closed loop mechanisms. Efficient models can be created by using tree structures in combination with constraints and very long chains should be avoided and replaced by (smaller) jointed chains if possible. The class Robot from exudyn.robotics can also be used to create kinematic trees, which are then exported as KinematicTree or as redundant multibody system. Use specialized settings in VisualizationSettings.bodies.kinematicTree for showing joint frames and other properties.

General notes
-------------

The \ ``KinematicTree``\  object is used to represent the equations of motion of a (open) tree-structured multibody system
using a minimal set of coordinates. Even though that Exudyn is based on redundant coordinates,
the \ ``KinematicTree``\  allows to efficiently model standard multibody models based on revolute and prismatic joints.
Especially, a chain with 3 links leads to only 3 equations of motion, while a redundant formulation would lead
to \ :math:`3 \times 7`\  coordinates using Euler Parameters and \ :math:`3 \times 6`\  constraints for joints and Euler parameters,
which gives a set of 39 equations. However this set of equations is very sparse and the evaluation is much faster
than the kinematic tree.

The question, which formulation to chose cannot be answered uniquely. However, \ ``KinematicTree``\  objects
do not include constraints, so they can be solved with explicit solvers. Furthermore, the joint values (angels)
can be addressed directly -- controllers or sensors are generally simpler.

General
-------

The equations follow the description given in Chapters 2 and 3 in the handbook of robotics, 2016 edition .

Functions like \ ``GetObjectOutputSuperElement(...)``\ , see Section :ref:`sec-mainsystem-object`\ , 
or \ ``SensorSuperElement``\ , see Section :ref:`sec-mainsystem-sensor`\ , directly access special output variables
(\ ``OutputVariableType``\ ) of the (mesh) nodes of the superelement. The mesh nodes are the links of the
\ ``KinematicTree``\ .

Note, however, that some functionality is considerably different for \ ``ObjectGenericODE2``\ .


Equations of motion
-------------------

The \ ``KinematicTree``\  has one node of type \ ``NodeGenericODE2``\  with \ :math:`n`\  coordinates.
The equations of motion are built by special multibody algorithms, following Featherstone . 
For a short introduction into this topic, see Chapter 3 of . 

The kinematic tree defines a set of rigid bodies connected by joints, having no loops.
In this way, every body \ :math:`i`\ , also denoted as link, has either a previous body \ :math:`p(i) \neq \mathrm{-1}`\  or not.
The previous body for body \ :math:`i`\  is \ :math:`p(i)`\ . The coordinates of joint \ :math:`i`\  are defined as \ :math:`q_i`\ .

The following joint transformations are considered (as homogeneous transformations):

+  \ :math:`{\mathbf{X}}_J(i)`\  \ :math:`\ldots`\  joint transformation due to rotation or translation
+  \ :math:`{\mathbf{X}}_L(i)`\  \ :math:`\ldots`\  link transformation (e.g. given by kinematics of mechanism)
+  \ :math:`\LU{i,\mathrm{-1}}{{\mathbf{X}}}`\  \ :math:`\ldots`\  transformation from global (-1) to local joint \ :math:`i`\  coordinates
+  \ :math:`\LU{i,p(i)}{{\mathbf{X}}}`\  \ :math:`\ldots`\  transformation from previous joint to joint \ :math:`i`\  coordinates

Furthermore, we use

   \ :math:`\tPhi_i`\  \ :math:`\ldots`\  motion subspace for joint \ :math:`i`\ 

which denotes the transformation from joint coordinate (scalar) to rotations and translations.
We can compute the local joint angular velocity \ :math:`\tomega_i`\  and translational velocity \ :math:`{\mathbf{w}}_i`\ , as a 6D vector \ :math:`{\mathbf{v}}^J_i`\ , from

.. math::

   {\mathbf{v}}^J_i = \vp{\tomega_i}{{\mathbf{w}}_i} = \tPhi_i \, \dot q_i


The joint coordinates, which can be rotational or translational, are stored in the vector

.. math::

   {\mathbf{q}} = [q_0, \, \ldots,\, q_{N_B-1}]\tp ,


and the vector of joint velocity coordinates reads

.. math::

   \dot {\mathbf{q}} = [\dot q_0, \, \ldots,\, \dot q_{N_B-1}]\tp .


Knowing the motion subspace \ :math:`\tPhi_i`\  for joint \ :math:`i`\ , the velocity of joint \ :math:`i`\  reads

.. math::

   {\mathbf{v}}_i = {\mathbf{v}}_{p(i)} + \tPhi_i \, \dot q_i ,


and accelerations follow as

.. math::

   {\mathbf{a}}_i = {\mathbf{a}}_{p(i)} + \tPhi_i \, \ddot q_i + \dot \tPhi_i \, \dot q_i.


Note that the previous formulas can be interpreted coordinate free, but they are usually implemented in joint coordinates.

The local forces due to applied forces and inertia forces are computed, for now independently, for every link,

.. math::

   {\mathbf{f}}_i = {\mathbf{I}}_i {\mathbf{a}}_i + {\mathbf{v}}_i \times {\mathbf{I}}_i {\mathbf{v}}_i - \LU{i,\mathrm{-1}}{{\mathbf{X}}\tp} \!\cdot\! \LU{\mathrm{-1}}{{\mathbf{f}}}^a


The total forces can be computed from inverse dynamics. 
At every free end of the tree, the forces are added up for the previous link, which needs to be done recursively starting at the leaves of the tree,

.. math::

   {\mathbf{f}}_{p(i)} \mathrel{+}=  \LU{i,p(i)}{{\mathbf{X}}\tp} \!\cdot {\mathbf{f}}_i


The mass matrix is then built by recursively computing the intertia of the links and adding the joint contributions by
projecting the local inertia into the joint motion space, see the composite-rigid-body algorithm.

Note that \ :math:`\cdot`\  for multiplication of matrices and vectors is added for clarity, especially in case of left and right indices.
The whole algorithm for forward and inverse dynamics is given in the following figures.

   Composite-rigid-body algorithm




Implementation and user functions
---------------------------------

Currently, there is only the so-called Composite-Rigid-Body (CRB) algorithm implemented.
This algorithm does not show the highest performance, but creates the mass matrix \ :math:`{\mathbf{M}}_{CRB}`\  and forces \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{CRB}`\ 
in a conventional form. The equations read

.. math::
   :label: eq-kinematictree-eom

   {\mathbf{M}}_{CRB}({\mathbf{q}}) \ddot {\mathbf{q}} = {\mathbf{f}}_{CRB}({\mathbf{q}},\dot {\mathbf{q}}) + {\mathbf{f}} + {\mathbf{f}}_{PD} + {\mathbf{f}}_{user}(mbs, t, i_N,{\mathbf{q}},\dot {\mathbf{q}})


The term \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{CRB}({\mathbf{q}},\dot {\mathbf{q}})`\  represents inertial terms, which are due to accelerations and 
quadratic velocities and is computed by \ ``ComputeODE2LHS``\ .
Note that the user function \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{user}(mbs, t, i_N,{\mathbf{q}},\dot {\mathbf{q}})`\  may be empty (=0), 
and \ ``iN``\  represents the itemNumber (=objectNumber). 
The force \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}`\  is given by the \ ``jointForceVector``\ , which also may have zero length, causing it to be ignored.
While \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}`\  is constant, it may be varied using a \ ``mbs.preStepUserFunction``\ , which can
then represent any force over time. Note that such changes are not considered in the object's jacobian.

The user force \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{user}`\  is described below and may represent any force over time.
Note that this force is considered in the object's jacobian, but it does not include external 
dependencies -- if a control law is feeds back measured quantities and couples them to forces.
This leads to worse performance (up to non-convergence) of implicit solvers.

The control force \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{PD}`\  realizes a simple linear control law

.. math::

   {\mathbf{f}}_{PD} = {\mathbf{P}} \cdot ({\mathbf{u}}_o - {\mathbf{q}}) + {\mathbf{D}} \cdot ({\mathbf{v}}_o - \dot {\mathbf{q}})


Here, the '.' operator represents an element-wise multiplication of two vectors, resulting in a vector.
The force \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{PD}`\  at the \ :ref:`RHS <RHS>`\  acts in direction of prescribed joint motion \ :math:`{\mathbf{u}}_o`\  and
prescribed joint velocities \ :math:`{\mathbf{v}}_o`\  multiplied with proportional and 'derivative' factors \ :math:`P`\  and \ :math:`D`\ .
Omitting \ :math:`{\mathbf{u}}_o`\  and \ :math:`{\mathbf{v}}_o`\  and putting \ :math:`{\mathbf{f}}_{PD}`\  on the \ :ref:`LHS <LHS>`\ , we immediately can interpret these
terms as stiffness and damping on the single coordinates.
The control force is also considered in the object's jacobian, which is currently computed by numerical
differentiation.
    
More detailed equations will be added later on. Follow exactly the description (and coordinate systems) of the object parameters,
especially for describing the kinematic chain as well as the inertial parameters.

\ **Userfunction**\ : ``forceUserFunction(mbs, t, itemNumber, q, q_t)`` 


A user function, which computes a force vector applied to the joint coordinates depending on current time and states of object. 
Note that itemNumber represents the index of the ObjectKinematicTree object in mbs, which can be used to retrieve additional data from the object through
\ ``mbs.GetObjectParameter(itemNumber, ...)``\ , see the according description of \ ``GetObjectParameter``\ .
