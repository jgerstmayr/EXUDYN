#%%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# This is an EXUDYN example
#
# Details:  Two rigid bodies, where the first body moves on a straight rail (fixed on ground) and the second is mounted with a revolute joint on the first body;
#           the particular reason for this test example is the copying of the model as well as load save;
#           shows reading and writing mbs with dictionaries and export by HDF5 files
