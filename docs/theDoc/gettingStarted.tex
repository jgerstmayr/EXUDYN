\mysubsubsection{What is \codeName ?}
\codeName -- {\small (fl\mybold{EX}ible m\mybold{U}ltibody \mybold{DYN}amics  -- \mybold{EX}tend yo\mybold{U}r \mybold{DYN}amics)}\vspace{6pt}\\
\noindent \codeName\ is a C++ based Python library for efficient simulation of flexible multibody dynamics systems.
It is the follow up code of the previously developed multibody code HOTINT, which Johannes Gerstmayr started during his PhD-thesis.
It seemed that the previous code HOTINT reached limits of further (efficient) development and it seemed impossible to continue from this code as it was outdated regarding programming techniques and the numerical formulation at the time \codeName\ was started.

\codeName\ is designed to easily set up complex multibody models, consisting of rigid and flexible bodies with joints, loads and other components. It shall enable automatized model setup and parameter variations, which are often necessary for system design but also for analysis of technical problems. The broad usability of Python allows to couple a multibody simulation with environments such as optimization, statistics, data analysis, machine learning and others.

The multibody formulation is mainly based on redundant coordinates. This means that computational objects (rigid bodies, flexible bodies, ...) are added as independent bodies to the system. Hereafter, connectors (e.g., springs or constraints) are used to interconnect the bodies. The connectors are using Markers on the bodies as interfaces, in order to transfer forces and displacements.
For details on the interaction of nodes, objects, markers and loads see \refSection{sec:items}.

\mysubsubsection{Developers of \codeName\ and thanks}
\codeName\ is currently (\the\month-\the\year) developed at the University of Innsbruck.
In the first phase most of the core code is written by Johannes Gerstmayr, implementing ideas that followed out of the project HOTINT. 15 years of development led to a lot of lessions learned and after 20 years, a code must be re-designed.

Some important tests for the coupling between C++ and Python have been written by Stefan Holzinger. Stefan also helped to set up the previous upload to GitLab and to test parallelization features.
For the interoperability between C++ and Python, we extensively use \mybold{Pybind11}\cite{pybind11}, originally written by Jakob Wenzel, see \texttt{https://github.com/pybind/pybind11}. Without Pybind11 we couldn't have made this project -- Thank's a lot!

Important discussions with researchers from the community were important for the design and development of \codeName , where we like to mention Joachim Sch{\"o}berl from TU-Vienna who boosted the design of the code with great concepts. 
%During a Comet-K2 cooperation project, several discussions with the TMECH/LCM group in Linz influenced the code development.

The cooperation and funding within the EU H2020-MSCA-ITN project 'Joint Training on Numerical Modelling of Highly Flexible Structures for Industrial Applications' contributes to the development of the code.

The following people have contributed to Python and C++ library implementations:
\bi
  \item Stefan Holzinger (Lie group solvers in Python)
  \item Peter Manzl (ConvexRoll Python / C++ implementation)
  \item Martin Sereinig (special robotics functionality)
\ei

The following people have contributed to the examples:

\mysubsection{Installation instructions}
\label{sec:installationInstructions}
%
\mysubsubsection{How to install \codeName ?}

In order to run \codeName , you need an appropriate Python installation.
We currently (2021-07) recommend to use
\bi
  \item \mybold{Anaconda, 64bit, Python 3.7.7}\footnote{Anaconda3 64bit with Python3.7.7 can be downloaded via the repository archive \texttt{https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/} choosing \texttt{Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86\_64.exe}} (but Python 3.8 is also working well!)
  \item \mybold{Spyder 4.1.3} (with Python 3.7.7, 64bit), which is included in the Anaconda installation\footnote{It is important that Spyder, Python and \codeName\  are \mybold{either} 32bit \mybold{or} 64bit and are compiled up to the same minor version, i.e., 3.7.x. There will be a strange .DLL error, if you mix up 32/64bit. It is possible to install both, Anaconda 32bit and Anaconda 64bit -- then you should follow the recommendations of paths as suggested by Anaconda installer.}
\ei
Many alternative options exist:
\bi
  \item In case that you have an older CPU, which does not support AVX2, use: Anaconda, 32bit, Python 3.6.5)\footnote{Anaconda 32bit with Python3.6 can be downloaded via the repository archive \texttt{https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/} choosing \texttt{Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86.exe}.}
  %\item Spyder 3.2.8 with Python 3.6.5 32 bit (alternatively 64bit), which is included in the Anaconda installation\footnote{It is important that Spyder, Python and exudyn are \mybold{either} 32bit \mybold{or} 64bit. 
  \item Users report successful use of \codeName\ with \mybold{Visual Studio Code}. \mybold{Jupyter} has been tested with some examples; both environments should work with default settings.
  \item Anaconda 2020-11 with \mybold{Python 3.8} and Spyder 4.1.5: no problems up to now (2021-07), TestSuite runs without problems since \codeName\ version 1.0.182.
  \item Alternative option with more stable Spyder (as compared to Spyder 4.1.3): Anaconda, 64bit, Python 3.6.5)\footnote{Anaconda 64bit with Python3.6 can be downloaded via the repository archive \texttt{https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/} choosing \texttt{Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86\_64.exe} for 64bit.}
  %\item Spyder 3.2.8 with Python 3.6.5 32 bit (alternatively 64bit), which is included in the Anaconda installation\footnote{It is important that Spyder, Python and exudyn are \mybold{either} 32bit \mybold{or} 64bit. 
%Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86\_64.exe
\ei
If you plan to extend the C++ code, we recommend to use VS2017\footnote{previously, VS2019 was recommended: However, VS2019 has problems with the library 'Eigen' and therefore leads to erroneous results with the sparse solver. VS2017 can also be configured with Python 3.7 now.} to compile your code, which offers Python 3.7 compatibility.
Once again, remember that Python versions and the version of the \codeName\ module must be identical (e.g., Python 3.6 32 bit \mybold{both} in the \codeName\ module and in Spyder).

\paragraph{Installation without Anaconda:}
If you do not install Anaconda (e.g., under Linux), make sure that you have the according Python packages installed:
\bi
  \item \texttt{numpy} (used throughout the code, inevitable)
  \item \texttt{matplotlib} (for any plot, also PlotSensor(...))
  \item \texttt{tkinter} (for interactive dialogs, SolutionViewer, etc.)
  \item \texttt{scipy} (needed for eigenvalue computation)
\ei
You can install most of these packages using \texttt{pip install numpy} (Windows) or \texttt{pip3 install numpy} (Linux).

For interaction (right-mouse-click, some key-board commands) you need the Python module \texttt{tkinter}. This is included in regular Anaconda distributions (recommended, see below), but on UBUNTU you need to type alike (do not forget the '3', otherwise it installs for Python2 ...):
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{sudo apt-get install python3-tk}
\ei
see also common blogs for your operating system.

%The simplest way to start is, to copy the files (and possibly further files that are needed)
%\bi
  %\item \texttt{exudynUtilities.py}
  %\item \texttt{itemInterface.py}
  %\item \texttt{exudyn.pyd}
%\ei
%to your working directory and directly import the modules as described in tutorials and examples.
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Install with Windows MSI installer}
The simplest way on Windows 10 (and maybe also Windows 7), which works well \mybold{if you installed only one Python version} and if you installed Anaconda with the option \mybold{'Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.x'} or similar, then you can use the provided \texttt{.msi} installers in the \texttt{main/dist} directory:
\bi
  \item For the 64bits Python 3.7 version, double click on (version may differ):\\ \texttt{exudyn-1.0.248.win-amd64-py3.7.msi}
  \item Follow the instructions of the installer
  \item If Python / Anaconda is not found by the installer, provide the 'python directory' as the installation directory of Anaconda3, which usually is installed in:\\
  \texttt{C:$\backslash$ProgramData$\backslash$Anaconda3}
\ei

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Install from Wheel (UBUNTU and Windows)}
The \mybold{standard way to install} the Python package \codeName\ is to use the so-called 'wheels' (file ending \texttt{.whl}) provided at the directory wheels in the \codeName\ repository. 
\vspace{6pt}\\
For UBUNTU18.04 (which by default uses Python 3.6) this may read (version number 1.0.20 may be different):
\bi
  \item \texttt{Python 3.6, 64bit}: pip3 install dist$\backslash$exudyn-1.0.20-cp36-cp36-linux\_x86\_64.whl
\ei
For UBUNTU20.04 (which by default uses Python 3.8) this may read (version number 1.0.20 may be different):
\bi
  \item \texttt{Python 3.8, 64bit}: pip3 install dist$\backslash$exudyn-1.0.20-cp38-cp38-linux\_x86\_64.whl
\ei
NOTE that your installation may have environments with different Python versions, so install that \codeName\ version appropriately!
If the wheel installation does not work on UBUNTU, it is highly recommended to build \codeName\ for your specific system as given in \refSection{sec:build:ubuntu}.

\noindent \mybold{Windows}:\vspace{6pt}\\
First, open an Anaconda prompt:
\bi
  \item EITHER calling: START->Anaconda->... OR go to anaconda/Scripts folder and call activate.bat
  \item You can check your Python version then, by running \texttt{Python}\footnote{\texttt{python3} under UBUNTU 18.04}, the output reads like:
  \bi
    \item[] \texttt{Python 3.6.5 $|$Anaconda, Inc.$|$ (default, Mar 29 2018, 13:32:41) $[$MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)$]$ on win32}
    \item[] ...
  \ei
  \item $\ra$ type \texttt{exit()} to close Python
\ei

\noindent \mybold{Go to the folder \texttt{Exudyn\_git/main}} (where \texttt{setup.py} lies) and choose the wheel in subdirectory \texttt{main/dist} according to your system (windows/UBUNTU), Python version (3.6 or 3.7) and 32 or 64 bits.

For Windows the installation commands may read (version number 1.0.20 may be different):
\bi
  \item \texttt{Python 3.6, 32bit}: pip install dist$\backslash$exudyn-1.0.20-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl
  \item \texttt{Python 3.6, 64bit}: pip install dist$\backslash$exudyn-1.0.20-cp36-cp36m-win\_amd64.whl
  \item \texttt{Python 3.7, 64bit}: pip install dist$\backslash$exudyn-1.0.20-cp37-cp37m-win\_amd64.whl
\ei

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Work without installation and editing \texttt{sys.path}}
The \mybold{uncommon and old way} ($\ra$ not recommended for \codeName\ versions $\ge$ 1.0.0) is to use Python's \texttt{sys} module to link to your \texttt{exudyn} (previously \texttt{WorkingRelease}) directory, for example:
\pythonstyle\begin{lstlisting}
  import sys
  sys.path.append('C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN_git/bin/EXUDYN32bitsPython36')
\end{lstlisting}
%
The folder \texttt{EXUDYN32bitsPython36} needs to be adapted to the location of the according \codeName\ package.
%In case of 64bit, it must be changed to \texttt{.... /bin/WorkingRelease64}.

%In the future, there will also be a possibility to install the module using pip commands -- we are happy, if somebody could do this!

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Build and install \codeName\ under Windows 10?}
\label{sec:build:windows}
Note that there are a couple of pre-requisites, depending on your system and installed libraries. For Windows 10, the following steps proved to work:
\bi
  \item install your Anaconda distribution including Spyder
  \item close all Python programs (e.g. Spyder, Jupyter, ...)
  \item run an Anaconda prompt (may need to be run as administrator)
  \item if you cannot run Anaconda prompt directly, do:
  \bi
    \item open windows shell (cmd.exe) as administrator (START $\ra$ search for cmd.exe $\ra$ right click on app $\ra$ 'run as administrator' if necessary)
    \item go to your Scripts folder inside the Anaconda folder (e.g. \texttt{C:$\backslash$ProgramData$\backslash$Anaconda$\backslash$Scripts})
    \item run 'activate.bat'
  \ei
  \item go to 'main' of your cloned github folder of exudyn
  \item run: \texttt{python setup.py install}
  \item read the output; if there are errors, try to solve them by installing appropriate modules
\ei
You can also create your own wheels, doing the above steps to activate the according Python version and then calling (requires installation of Microsoft Visual Studio; recommended: VS2017):
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{python setup.py bdist\_wheel}
\ei
This will add a wheel in the \texttt{dist} folder.

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Build and install \codeName\ under Mac OS X?}
\label{sec:build:MacOS}
Installation and building on Mac OS X is rarely tested, but first successful compilation including GLFW has been achieved.
Requirements are an according Anaconda installation.

\noindent \mybold{Tested configuration}:
\bi
  \item Mac OS X 10.11.6 'El Capitan', Mac Pro (2010), 3.33GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon, 4GB Memory
  \item Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7
  \item Python 3.7.0
  \item Spyder 3.3.6
\ei
For a compatible Mac OS X system, you can install the pre-compiled wheel (go to local directory). Go to the \texttt{main/dist} directory in your back terminal and type, e.g.,
\bi
\item[] \texttt{pip install exudyn-1.0.218-cp37-cp37m-macosx\_10\_9\_x86\_64.whl} \vspace{9pt}\\
\ei

If you would like to compile from source, just use a bash terminal on your Mac, and do the following steps inside the \texttt{main} directory of your repository and type
\bi
  \item \texttt{python setup.py bdist\_wheel}
  \item[] $\ra$ this compiles and takes approx.~5 minutes, depending on your machine
  \item[] $\ra$ it may produce some errors, depending on your version; if there are some liker errors (saying that there is no '\texttt{-framework Cocoa' and '-framework OpenGL}', just go back in the terminal and copy everything from '\texttt{g++ ...}' until the end of the last command '\texttt{-mmacosx-verion-min...}' and paste it into the terminal. Callsing that again will finalize linking; then run again
  \item[] \texttt{python setup.py bdist\_wheel}
  \item[] $\ra$ this now creates the wheel (if you want to distribute) in the \texttt{dist} folder
  \item[] alternatively just call
  \item \texttt{python setup.py install}
  \item[] to install exudyn
\ei
Then just go to the \texttt{pythonDev/Examples} folder and run an example:
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{python springDamperUserFunctionTest.py}
\ei
If you have a new system, try to adapt \texttt{setup.py} accordingly, e.g., activating the \texttt{-std=c++17} support.
If there are other issues, we are happy to receive your detailed bug reports. 

\noindent Note that you need to run 
\bi
\item[] \texttt{exudyn.StartRenderer()}
\item[] \texttt{exudyn.DoRendererIdleTasks(-1)}
\ei
in order to interact with the render window, as there is only a single-threaded version available for Mac OS.

\mysubsubsection{Build and install \codeName\ under UBUNTU?}
\label{sec:build:ubuntu}
Having a new UBUNTU 18.04 standard installation (e.g. using a VM virtual box environment), the following steps need to be done (Python \mybold{3.6} is already installed on UBUNTU18.04, otherwise use \texttt{sudo apt install python3})\footnote{see also the youtube video: \texttt{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZduTa9mdcmOh5KVUqatD9GzVg\_jtl6fx}}:

\noindent First update ...
\plainlststyle
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo apt-get update
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 
Install necessary Python libraries and pip3; \texttt{matplotlib} and\texttt{scipy} are not required for installation but used in \codeName\ examples:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo dpkg --configure -a
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  pip3 install numpy
  pip3 install matplotlib
  pip3 install scipy
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Install pybind11 (needed for running the setup.py file derived from the pybind11 example):
\begin{lstlisting}
  pip3 install pybind11
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 
If graphics is used (\texttt{\#define USE\_GLFW\_GRAPHICS} in \texttt{BasicDefinitions.h}), you must install the according GLFW and OpenGL libs:
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
  sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
  sudo apt-get install libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev xorg-dev libglew1.5 libglew1.5-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 
With all of these libs, you can run the setup.py installer (go to \texttt{Exudyn\_git/main} folder), which takes some minutes for compilation (the --user option is used to install in local user folder):
\begin{lstlisting}
  sudo python3 setup.py install --user
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 
Congratulation! \mybold{Now, run a test example} (will also open an OpenGL window if successful):
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{python3 pythonDev/Examples/rigid3Dexample.py}
\ei

\noindent You can also create a UBUNTU wheel which can be easily installed on the same machine (x64), same operating system (UBUNTU18.04) and with same Python version (e.g., 3.6):
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{sudo pip3 install wheel}
  \item[] \texttt{sudo python3 setup.py bdist\_wheel}
\ei

\noindent \mybold{KNOWN issues for linux builds}:
\bi
  \item Using \mybold{WSL2} (Windows subsystem for linux), there occur some conflicts during build because of incompatible windows and linux file systems and builds will not be copied to the dist folder; workaround: go to explorer, right click on 'build' directory and set all rights for authenticated user to 'full access'
  \item \mybold{compiler (gcc,g++) conflicts}: It seems that \codeName works well on UBUNTU18.04 with the original \texttt{Python 3.6.9} and \texttt{gcc-7.5.0} version as well as with UBUNTU20.04 with \texttt{Python 3.8.5} and \texttt{gcc-9.3.0}. Upgrading \texttt{gcc} on a linux system with Python 3.6 to, e.g., \texttt{gcc-8.2} showed us a linker error when loading the \codeName\ module in Python -- there are some common restriction using \texttt{gcc} versions different from those with which the Python version has been built. Starting \texttt{python} or \texttt{python3} on your linux machine shows you the \texttt{gcc} version it had been build with.
  Check your current \texttt{gcc} version with: \texttt{gcc --version}
\ei

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsubsection{Uninstall \codeName }

To uninstall exudyn under Windows, run (may require admin rights):
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{pip uninstall exudyn}
\ei
\noindent To uninstall under UBUNTU, run:
\bi
  \item[] \texttt{sudo pip3 uninstall exudyn}
\ei

If you upgrade to a newer version, uninstall is usually not necessary!
%
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

\mysubsubsection{How to install \codeName\ and use the C++ source code (advanced)?}
\codeName\ is still under intensive development of core modules.
There are several ways of using the code, but you \mybold{cannot} install \codeName\ as compared to other executable programs and apps.
\vspace{6pt}\\
%\mybold{Ways to use \codeName }:
In order to make full usage of the C++ code and extending it, you can use:
\bi
  \item Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and above:
  \bi
    \item get the files from git
    \item put them into a local directory (recommended: \texttt{C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN\_git})
    \item start \texttt{main\_sln.sln} with Visual Studio
    \item compile the code and run \texttt{main/pythonDev/pytest.py} example code
    \item adapt \texttt{pytest.py} for your applications
    \item extend the C++ source code
    \item link it to your own code
    \item NOTE: on Linux systems, you mostly need to replace '$/$' with '$\backslash$'
  \ei
  \item Linux, etc.: not fully supported yet; however, all external libraries are Linux-compatible and thus should run with minimum adaptation efforts.
\ei
%
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsection{Further notes}
\mysubsubsection{Goals of \codeName}
After the first development phase (2019-2020), it shall
\bi
  \item be a small multibody library, which can be easily linked to other projects,
  \item allow to efficiently simulate small scale systems (compute 100000s time steps per second for systems with $n_{DOF}<10$),
  \item allow to efficiently simulate medium scaled systems for problems with $n_{DOF} < 1\,000\,000$,
  \item safe and widely accessible module for Python,
  \item allow to add user defined objects in C++,
  \item allow to add user defined solvers in Python.
\ei
Future goals are:
\bi
  \item extend tests,
  \item add more multi-threaded parallel computing techniques (first trials implemented, improvements planned: Q3 2021),
  \item add vectorization,
  \item add specific and advanced connectors/constraints (3D revolute joint and prismatic joint instead of generic joint, extended wheels, contact, control connector)
  \item more interfaces for robotics,
  \item add 3D beams,
  \item extend floating frame of reference formulation with modal reduction
\ei
For specific open issues, see \texttt{trackerlog.html}.

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\mysubsection{Run a simple example in Spyder}
After performing the steps of the previous section, this section shows a simplistic model which helps you to check if \codeName\ runs on your computer.

In order to start, run the Python interpreter Spyder.
For the following example, 
\bi
\ignoreRST{
\item open Spyder and copy the example provided in Listing \ref{lst:firstexample} into a new file, or}
\item open \texttt{myFirstExample.py} from your \texttt{EXUDYN32bitsPython36}\footnote{or any other directory according to your Python version} directory
\ei
Hereafter, press the play button or \texttt{F5} in Spyder.
%\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{../../main/bin/WorkingRelease/myFirstExample.py}
\ignoreRST{
\pythonexternal[language=Python, frame=single, float, label=lst:firstexample, caption=My first example]{../../main/pythonDev/Examples/myFirstExample.py}
}

If successful, the IPython Console of Spyder will print something like:
\begin{lstlisting}
  runfile('C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN_git/main/bin/EXUDYN32bitsPython36/myFirstExample.py', 
    wdir='C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN_git/main/bin/EXUDYN32bitsPython36')
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  EXUDYN V1.0.1 solver: implicit second order time integration
  STEP100, t = 1 sec, timeToGo = 0 sec, Nit/step = 1
  solver finished after 0.0007824 seconds.
\end{lstlisting}
  %runfile('C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN_git/main/bin/WorkingRelease/myFirstExample.py', 
    %wdir='C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN_git/main/bin/WorkingRelease')

If you check your current directory (where \texttt{myFirstExample.py} lies), you will find a new file \texttt{coordinatesSolution.txt}, which contains the results of your computation (with default values for time integration).
The beginning and end of the file should look like: \vspace{6pt}\\
\begin{lstlisting}
  #Exudyn generalized alpha solver solution file
  #simulation started=2019-11-14,20:35:12

  #number of written coordinates [nODE2, nVel2, nAcc2, nODE1, nVel1, nAlgebraic, nData] = [2,2,2,0,0,0,0]
  #total columns exported  (excl. time) = 6
  #number of time steps (planned) = 100
  #

Within this file, the first column shows the simulation time and the following columns provide solution of coordinates, their derivatives and Lagrange multipliers on system level. As expected, the $x$-coordinate of the point mass has constant acceleration $a=f/m=0.001/10=0.0001$, the velocity grows up to $0.0001$ after 1 second and the point mass moves $0.00005$ along the $x$-axis.

\noindent \mybold{Python import errors}:
\bi
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  \item Sometimes the \codeName\ module cannot be loaded into Python. Typical \mybold{error messages if Python versions are not compatible} are: \vspace{1pt}\\
\plainlststyle
\begin{lstlisting}
  Traceback (most recent call last):

    File "<ipython-input-14-df2a108166a6>", line 1, in <module>
      import exudynCPP

  ImportError: Module use of python36.dll conflicts with this version of Python.
\end{lstlisting}
%
  Typical \mybold{error messages if 32/64 bits versions are mixed}:\vspace{1pt}\\
\begin{lstlisting}
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  
    File "<ipython-input-2-df2a108166a6>", line 1, in <module>
      import exudynCPP

  ImportError: DLL load failed: \%1 is not a valid Win32 application.
\end{lstlisting}
%
  \mybold{There are several reasons and workarounds}:
\bi
\item[$\ra$] You mixed up 32 and 64 bits version (see below) 
\item[$\ra$] You are using an exudyn version for Python $x_1.y_1$ (e.g., 3.6.$z_1$) different from the Python $x_2.y_2$ version in your Anaconda (e.g., 3.7.$z_2$); note that $x_1=x_2$ and $y_1=y_2$ must be obeyed while $z_1$ and $z_2$ may be different
\ei
\item \mybold{ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'exudynCPP'}:\\
\bi
\item[$\ra$] A known reason is that your CPU \mybold{does not support AVX2}, while \codeName\ is compiled with the AVX2 option\footnote{modern Intel Core-i3, Core-i5 and Core-i7 processors as well as AMD processors, especially Zen and Zen-2 architectures should have no problems with AVX2; however, low-cost Celeron, Pentium and older AMD processors do \mybold{not} support AVX2, e.g.,  Intel Celeron G3900, Intel core 2 quad q6600, Intel Pentium Gold G5400T; check the system settings of your computer to find out the processor type; typical CPU manufacturer pages or Wikipedia provide information on this}.
\item[$\ra$] \mybold{workaround} to solve the AVX problem: use the Python 3.6 32bits version, which is compiled without AVX2; you can also compile for your specific Python version without AVX if you adjust the \texttt{setup.py} file in the \texttt{main} folder.
\item[$\ra$] The \texttt{ModuleNotFoundError} may also happen if something went wrong during installation (paths, problems with Anaconda, ..) $\ra$ very often a new installation of Anaconda and \codeName\ helps.

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\noindent \mybold{Typical Python errors}:
\bi
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  \item Typical Python \mybold{syntax error} with missing braces:
\plainlststyle
\begin{lstlisting}
  File "C:\DATA\cpp\EXUDYN_git\main\pythonDev\Examples\springDamperTutorial.py", line 42
      nGround=mbs.AddNode(NodePointGround(referenceCoordinates = [0,0,0]))
             ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{lstlisting}
%
\item[$\ra$] such an error points to the line of your code (line 42), but in fact the error may have been caused in previous code, such as in this case there was a missing brace in the line 40, which caused the error:
\pythonstyle\begin{lstlisting}
  38  n1=mbs.AddNode(Point(referenceCoordinates = [L,0,0], 
  39                       initialCoordinates = [u0,0,0], 
  40                       initialVelocities= [v0,0,0])	
  41  #ground node
  42  nGround=mbs.AddNode(NodePointGround(referenceCoordinates = [0,0,0]))
  43  
\end{lstlisting}

\item Typical Python \mybold{import error} message on Linux / UBUNTU if Python modules are missing:
\plainlststyle
\begin{lstlisting}

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\noindent \mybold{Typical solver errors}:
\bi
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item \texttt{SolveDynamic} or \texttt{SolveStatic} \mybold{terminated due to errors}:
\bi
\item[$\ra$] use flag \texttt{showHints = True} in \texttt{SolveDynamic} or \texttt{SolveStatic}
\ei
\item Very simple example \mybold{without loads} leads to error: \texttt{SolveDynamic} or \texttt{SolveStatic} \mybold{terminated due to errors}:
\bi
\item[$\ra$] if you do not add loads to the system and if there are no forces, the residual nearly gives 0 (due to round off errors). The Newton solver tries to reduce the error by the factor given in \texttt{simulationSettings.staticSolver.newton.relativeTolerance} (for static solver), which is not possible for 0 residual. The absolute tolerance is helping out as a lower bound for the error, given in \texttt{simulationSettings.staticSolver.newton.absoluteTolerance} (for static solver), which is by default rather low (1e-10). Increasing this value helps to solve unloaded problems. Nevertheless, you should usually set this tolerance as low as possible because otherwise, your solution may become inaccurate.
\ei
\item Typical \mybold{solver error due to redundant constraints or missing inertia terms}, could read as follows:
%\plainlststyle
	%{\ttfamily \footnotesize
	%\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, breaklines=true]
\begin{lstlisting}

\bi
\item[$\ra$] this solver error shows that equation 42 is not solvable. The according coordinate is shown later in such an error message:
\ei
\begin{lstlisting}

  Potential object number(s) causing linear solver to fail: [7]

\bi
\item[$\ra$] object 7 seems to be the reason, possibly there are too much (joint) constraints applied to your system, check this object.
\item[$\ra$] show typical REASONS and SOLUTIONS, by using \texttt{showHints=True} in \texttt{exu.SolveDynamic(...)} or \texttt{exu.SolveStatic(...)}
\item[$\ra$] You can also \mybold{highlight} object 7 by using the following code in the iPython console:
\ei
\pythonstyle\begin{lstlisting}
  exu.StartRenderer()
  HighlightItem(SC,mbs,7)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}
%
\bi
\item[$\ra$] this solver error is caused, because the nonlinear system cannot be solved using Newton's method.
\item[$\ra$] the static or dynamic solver by default tries to reduce step size to overcome this problem, but may fail finally (at minimum step size).
\item[$\ra$] possible reasons are: too large time steps (reduce step size by using more steps/second), inappropriate initial conditions, or inappropriate joints or constraints (remove joints to see if they are the reason), usually within a singular configuration. Sometimes a system may be just unsolvable in the way you set it up.

\item[$\ra$] this indicates an error in the user function \texttt{LoadCoordinate::loadVectorUserFunction}, because \texttt{sin} function has not been defined (must be imported, e.g., from \texttt{math}).

\mysubsubsection{FAQ}
\mybold{Some frequently asked questions}:
\bn
\item When \mybold{importing} \codeName\ in Python (windows) I get an error 
\item[$\ra$] see trouble shooting instructions above!
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item I do not understand the \mybold{Python errors} -- how can I find the reason of the error or crash?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] Read trouble shooting section above!	
\item[$\ra$] First, you should read all error messages and warnings: from the very first to the last message. Very often, there is a definite line number which shows the error. Note, that if you are executing a string (or module) as a Python code, the line numbers refer to the local line number inside the script or module.
\item[$\ra$] If everything fails, try to execute only part of the code to find out where the first error occurs. By omiting parts of the code, you should find the according source of the error.
\item[$\ra$] If you think, it is a bug: send an email with a representative code snippet, version, etc.\ to \texttt{ reply.exudyn@gmail.com}
\ei
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item Spyder \mybold{console hangs} up, does not show error messages, ...:
\bi
\item[$\ra$] very often a new start of Spyder helps; most times, it is sufficient to restart the kernel or to just press the 'x' in your IPython console, which closes the current session and restarts the kernel (this is much faster than restarting Spyder)
\item[$\ra$] restarting the IPython console also brings back all error messages
\ei
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item Where do I find the \mybold{'.exe' file}?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] \codeName\ is only available via the Python interface as a module '\texttt{exudyn}', the C++ code being inside of \texttt{exudynCPP.pyd}, which is located in the exudyn folder where you installed the package. This means that you need to \mybold{run Python} (best: Spyder) and import the \codeName\ module.
\ei
	%
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item I get the error message 'check potential mixing of different (object, node, marker, ...) indices', what does it mean?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] probably you used wrong item indexes, see beginning of command interface in \refSection{sec:PCpp:command:interface}. 
\item[$\ra$] E.g., an object number \texttt{oNum = mbs.AddObject(...)} is used at a place where a \texttt{NodeIndex} is expected, e.g., \texttt{mbs.AddObject(MassPoint(nodeNumber=oNum, ...))}
\item[$\ra$] Usually, this is an ERROR in your code, it does not make sense to mix up these indexes!
\item[$\ra$] In the exceptional case, that you want to convert numbers, see beginning of \refSection{sec:PCpp:command:interface}.

  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item Why does \mybold{type auto completion} not work for mbs (MainSystem)?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] UPDATE 2020-06-01: with Spyder 4, using Python 3.7, type auto completion works much better, but may find too many completions.
\item[$\ra$] most Python environments (e.g., with Spyder 3) only have information up to the first sub-structure, e.g., \texttt{SC=exu.SystemContainer()} provides full access to SC in the type completion, but \texttt{mbs=SC.AddSystem()} is at the second sub-structure of the module and is not accessible.
\item[$\ra$] WORKAROUND: type \texttt{mbs=MainSystem()} \mybold{before} the \texttt{mbs=SC.AddSystem()} command and the interpreter will know what type mbs is. This also works for settings, e.g., simulation settings 'Newton'.
\ei
	%
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item How to add graphics?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] Graphics (lines, text, 3D triangular / STL mesh) can be added to all BodyGraphicsData items in objects. Graphics objects which are fixed with the background can be attached to a ObjectGround object. Moving objects must be attached to the BodyGraphicsData of a moving body. Other moving bodies can be realized, e.g., by adding a ObjectGround and changing its reference with time. Furthermore, ObjectGround allows to add fully user defined graphics.
\ei
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item In \texttt{GenerateStraightLineANCFCable2D} 
\bi
\item[$\ra$] coordinate constraints can be used to constrain position and rotation, e.g., \texttt{fixedConstraintsNode0 = [1,1,0,1]} for a beam aligned along the global x-axis; 
\item[$\ra$] this \mybold{does not work} for beams with arbitrary rotation in reference configuration, e.g., 45°. Use a GenericJoint with a rotationMarker instead.
\ei
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  %++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item What is the difference between MarkerBodyPosition and MarkerBodyRigid?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] Position markers (and nodes) do not have information on the orientation (rotation). For that reason, there is a difference between position based and rigid-body based markers. In case of a rigid body attached to ground with a SpringDamper, you can use both, MarkerBodyPosition or MarkerBodyRigid, markers. For a prismatic joint, you will need a MarkerBodyRigid.
\ei
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item I get an error in \texttt{exu.SolveDynamic(mbs, ...)} OR in \texttt{exu.SolveStatic(mbs, ...)} but no further information -- how can I solve it?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] Typical \mybold{time integration errors} may look like:
\begin{lstlisting}
  File "C:/DATA/cpp/EXUDYN\_git/main/pythonDev/...<file name>", line XXX, in <module>
  solver.SolveSystem(...)
  SystemError: <built-in method SolveSystem of PyCapsule object at 0x0CC63590> returned a result with an error set
\end{lstlisting}
%
\item[$\ra$] The pre-checks, which are performed to enable a crash-free simulation are insufficient for your model
%
\item[$\ra$] As a first try, \mybold{restart the IPython console} in order to get all error messages, which may be blocked due to a previous run of \codeName.
%
\item[$\ra$] Very likely, you are using Python user functions inside \codeName\ : They lead to an internal Python error, which is not always catched by \codeName\ ; e.g., a load user function UFload(mbs,~t,~load), which tries to access component load[3] of a load vector with 3 components will fail internally;
%
\item[$\ra$] Use the print(...) command in Python at many places to find a possible error in user functions (e.g., put \texttt{print("Start user function XYZ")} at the beginning of every user function; test user functions from iPython console
%
\item[$\ra$] It is also possible, that you are using inconsistent data, which leads to the crash. In that case, you should try to change your model: omit parts and find out which part is causing your error
%
\item[$\ra$] see also \mybold{I do not understand the Python errors -- how can I find the cause?}
\ei

%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\item Why can't I get the focus of the simulation window on startup (render window hidden)?
\bi
\item[$\ra$] Starting \codeName\ out of Spyder might not bring the simulation window to front, because of specific settings in Spyder(version 3.2.8), e.g., Tools$\ra$Preferences$\ra$Editor$\ra$Advanced settings: uncheck 'Maintain focus in the Editor after running cells or selections'; Alternatively, set \texttt{SC.visualizationSettings.window.alwaysOnTop=True} \mybold{before} starting the renderer with \texttt{exu.StartRenderer()}
