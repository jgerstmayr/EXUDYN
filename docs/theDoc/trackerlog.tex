This section contains resolved issues per release and known bugs. Use this information to understand changes compared to previous versions. The mentioning of author is omitted if it was Johannes Gerstmayr (JG).
The extension \texttt{.dev1} is not added in the issues list (e.g., 1.2.2.dev1==1.2.2), as it only marks versions that will not be available in pypi with standard pip install, but only with the \texttt{--pre} option or by specifying the exact version name, see versions on \exuUrl{https://pypi.org/project/exudyn/}{https://pypi.org/project/exudyn/}.
BUG numbers refer to the according issue numbers.
For details, see the \texttt{trackerlog.html} file.
