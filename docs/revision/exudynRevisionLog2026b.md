# Exudyn Revision Log 2026b

What was done and found in [`exudynRevisionPlan2026b.md`](exudynRevisionPlan2026b.md), in
plan order: one entry per closed step, with the anchor of its number (`<a id="rg8-1"></a>`),
a heading `### RG8.1 — title (date)`, and what the work actually turned out to be — the
measurements, the surprises, and what was decided against.

The log of the first plan, [`exudynRevisionLog2026.md`](exudynRevisionLog2026.md), is closed:
it records a revision that completed as 1.12 and is never appended to again. **A closed entry
is never edited** in either log; a fact that turns out wrong is corrected in
[`exudynRevisionInfo2026.md`](exudynRevisionInfo2026.md), which both plans share, with a dated
note here.

### RG3.1 — the manual gets its structure back (2026-09-22, #2584)

The conversion of revision2026 step R7.1.5 put the `toctree` of `introduction.md` **below its
last section**. Sphinx nests what a toctree lists under the section it stands in, so the
documentation showed *Exudyn Basics*, *Advanced topics* and *C++ Code* as sub-pages of
**"Mapping between local and global coordinate indices"** — three chapters filed under a
paragraph about index arithmetic. It built without a warning, because nothing about it is
invalid; it was simply wrong, and it stayed wrong for a week until the maintainer read the
sidebar.

**What the manual looks like now** (maintainer, 2026-09-22):

```
README
Installation and Getting Started     <- was after "Overview on Exudyn"
Overview on Exudyn
  Items: Nodes, Objects, Loads, Markers, Sensors, ...
    ... Reference coordinates and displacements
    Mapping between local and global coordinate indices   <- was a chapter-level section
Exudyn Basics                        <- was a sub-page
Advanced topics                      <- was a sub-page
Tutorial, Graphics, the command line, ...
```

**The C++ chapter is gone, and that is the part worth recording.** It held three kinds of
material, and two of them existed twice:

- *the four principles* — developer-friendly, error minimization, user-friendliness,
  efficiency, in that order, and what follows from the order — existed **only** there. It is
  the "why" of the C++ side and is now the opening section of `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- *code style, notation conventions, the no-abbreviations rule* — `docs/dev/CODING_STYLE.md`
  §1-§5 carries all of it, in tables, and is the document that is maintained. Dropped.
- *the module list and the entry points* — `ARCHITECTURE.md` has a current table; the
  manual's list still named `Objects:` and `pythonGenerator`. Dropped.
- *how to implement a new item in C++* — the opposite case: the manual had **two worked
  cases** (a body and a connector, with every function to implement and what each one is for),
  while `CODING_STYLE.md` §9 said *"TBD after the current 2026 revision"*. That section now
  carries them, with the file names of the current layout (`definitions/itemDefs<Kind>.py`,
  `python tools/regenerate.py`, `msvc/cppsrc.vcxproj`) and the advice that came with them:
  **write it in Python first with user functions, and go to C++ when that works and is too
  slow.**

What the manual keeps is a short **"The C++ core"** section in *Advanced topics*: what happens
in C++ at all, and two links into the developer documentation for the two questions people
actually ask. A user of a wheel needs no more; a developer was reading the wrong copy.

The structure was invisible to every check — `-W` catches a broken reference, not a chapter
in the wrong place. This one needed a person to look at the sidebar.
